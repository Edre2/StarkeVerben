# StarkeVerben
Little project to learn the irregular verbs in german in the terminal.
# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Edre2/StarkeVerben
cd StarkeVerben
pyhton3 main.py
```
# Changing the verbs
To change the verbs, edit `verbs.csv` and in `main.py`, make sure to change the variables `NUMBER_OF_FORMS_DE` and `NUMBER_OF_FORMS_FR` so that it gets the correct elements as the germans and french forms of the verbs
